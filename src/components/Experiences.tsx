At RTS Labs, I built a full-stack app that automated ad design, cutting creation time by 40%. When designers rejected our first template-based approach, I pivoted to AI-generated backgrounds to keep the process fast yet creative. I also worked on a cGAN model for automated design generation and built a Flask API to handle backend operations. It was a crash course in balancing automation with human creativityâ€”and in making AI actually useful. ðŸš€

        At UVAâ€™s Spin Physics Lab, I work alongside Fermilab physicists and researchers, using machine learning to analyze particle accelerator data. I build and optimize deep neural networks to extract Compton form factorsâ€”basically, I help uncover the 3D structure of protons at the subatomic level!

        As the DevOps lead for our student project, I managed the CI/CD pipeline and streamlined our cloud deployment using Docker and Kubernetes. I helped our team set up automated workflows, making sure our development and deployment process was smooth, scalable, and didnâ€™t break every time we pushed an update.
